    "Here's how lasso regression differs from other regression techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization: Lasso Regression adds a penalty term to the standard linear regression objective function. This penalty term is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients multiplied by a regularization parameter (alpha). This encourages the model to shrink the coefficients of less important features to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection: Unlike some other regression techniques like ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, Lasso Regression inherently performs feature selection by driving the coefficients of irrelevant features to zero. This can be very useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets with many irrelevant or redundant features."

    "Automatic Feature Selection: Lasso Regression inherently performs feature selection by shrinking the coefficients of irrelevant features to zero. This means you don't need to manually examine the importance of each feature or rely on domain knowledge to select features. The feature selection process is integrated into the model training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handles Collinearity: Lasso Regression is robust to multicollinearity, which occurs when two or more features are highly correlated. When multicollinearity is present, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression can produce unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates. Lasso Regression effectively chooses one of the correlated features and sets the coefficients of the others to zero, helping to alleviate the issues caused by multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduces Overfitting: By penalizing the absolute values of the coefficients, Lasso Regression helps to prevent overfitting by imposing a constraint on the model complexity. This regularization encourages simpler models and reduces the risk of fitting noise in the data, leading to better generalization performance on unseen data."
